Grails has built-in support for handling
[duplicated form submissions|http://grails.org/doc/2.2.1/ref/Controllers/withForm.html]
using the "Synchronizer Token Pattern".
After defining a token on the form tag, each submission will be combined with a unique token before being processed.
Grails checks the token of each submission. Duplicated tokens mean duplicated submissions.

This mechanism makes use of the session and hence requires session affinity or clustered sessions if used in a cluster.
