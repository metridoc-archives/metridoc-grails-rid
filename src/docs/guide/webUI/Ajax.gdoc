Ajax is used in this project to create asynchronous web applications.

As user chooses different ‘Library Unit’ when creating a RidTransacton instance, the items in
‘Mode of Consultation’, ‘Service Provided’ and ‘User Goal will change’. With Ajax, web applications
can send data of ‘Library Unit’ to, and retrieve data from the server asynchronously (in the background)
without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
Here, data is retrieved using JSON, and jQuery is used to change the items in those three drop-down list boxes.
